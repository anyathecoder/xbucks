Develop a cross-platform neobank application using Python (Kivy) that runs on Android, iOS, and Desktop.
The system is powered by a custom decentralized blockchain with a novel Proof of Diplomacy (PoD) consensus protocol, supporting multi-currency fiat tokens, crypto, P2P lending, savings, and instant cross-border transfers.

Key Features:

1. Cross-Platform Frontend

- Kivy-based UI (single codebase for Android, iOS, Desktop).

- Wallet interface: balances, transaction history, transfers, loan requests, and savings dashboards.

- Secure key management (private keys stored encrypted, platform keystores where available).

2. Blockchain Layer (XBucks)

- Native blockchain with PoD consensus:

- Hybrid federated voting + stake + one-time PoW puzzles for validator credibility.

- Validators are KYC/AML verified.

- Multi-round voting, supermajority (>⅔) for finality.

- Support for multiple fiat token types (USD, EUR, etc.) and native XBucks crypto.

- Smart contracts for P2P lending and savings pools.

3. Financial Services

- Fiat deposits & withdrawals: via Rapyd API integration.

- Cross-currency swaps: on-chain AMM or trusted liquidity provider.

- Crypto ↔ Fiat on/off ramps (via Rapyd + stablecoins).

- Peer-to-Peer lending: borrowers create requests, lenders fund via smart contracts.

- Savings accounts: earn yield from lending pool or protocol-defined rewards.

4. Security & Compliance

- End-to-end encryption of transactions.

- Private key custody stays with users.

- Validator KYC enforcement (PoD governance).

- Regulatory-ready logging and audit trail.

Technical Requirements:
---------------------------
Frontend: Python (Kivy), packaged with Buildozer (Android), Kivy iOS toolchain, PyInstaller (Desktop).

Blockchain: Custom Python-based blockchain module implementing PoD consensus.

APIs:
- Rapyd for fiat rails (deposits/withdrawals, currency conversion).

- Internal API for node RPC (transaction submission, querying balances).

- Smart Contracts: Python-based contract layer for lending/savings.

- Storage: On-chain ledger; optional off-chain indexer for UI queries.

Milestones & Deliverables:
----------------------------
Phase 1 – Foundations
 - Set up project repo and CI/CD pipeline.

 - Initialize Kivy frontend project (multi-platform UI boilerplate).

 - Create basic wallet interface (generate keys, display balance, send/receive placeholder transactions).

Phase 2 – Blockchain Core (PoD)
 - Implement blockchain ledger structure (blocks, transactions, accounts).

 - Implement PoD consensus algorithm:

 - Block proposer selection (weighted by stake + reliability).

 - Multi-round voting with >⅔ finality.

 - Validator weight adjustments via stake & one-time PoW.

 - Unit tests for consensus stability and fork prevention.

Phase 3 – Financial Layer
 - Implement multi-currency tokens (USD, EUR, etc.) on blockchain.

 - Add cross-currency transfers (AMM-based or oracle-priced).

 - Integrate Rapyd API for fiat deposits/withdrawals.

 - Implement crypto-to-fiat swaps with Rapyd and on-chain stablecoins.

Phase 4 – Lending & Savings
 - Smart contract system (Python-based).

 - P2P Lending contracts:
   * Borrower posts loan terms.
   * Lenders fund loan.
   * Contract enforces repayment with interest.

 - Savings contracts:
   * Users lock tokens.
   * Interest distributed periodically from lending pool.

Phase 5 – Security & Compliance
 - Encrypted wallet storage (local device + platform keystore).

 - KYC/AML enforcement for validators and fiat operations.

 - Logging and audit trail for compliance.

 - Security review of consensus and contracts.

Phase 6 – Polishing & Deployment
 - Build for Android, iOS, and Desktop.

 - UI/UX refinement (transaction history, charts, lending dashboards, mining dashboards, account settings).

 - Integrate notifications for transactions and loan events.

-  Deploy testnet for blockchain + release alpha version of app.

👉 Instruction to Vibe Coder / AI Agent:
“Please follow the milestones strictly in order. At each phase, generate production-ready, modular, well-documented code in Python. Ensure Rapyd integration is correct for deposits/withdrawals, and test blockchain consensus thoroughly before implementing financial services. Always provide unit tests and security considerations per milestone.”
