# Proof - Of - Diplomacy anti - spam system
# A proof - of - originality system used to time - check, vote and confirm transactions
# It is one of the fastest trasnaction confirmation systems
# The proof is based on the Theory of Random Validity
# Since, two people cannot have the same thought at the same time, a transaction has to be verified by n independent stakeholders
# Each computes a simple Hashcash puzzle and appends it to the transaction. 
# The Hashcash puzzle will be increased if the same user tries to confirm it again.
# It increases (with an additional zero collision) until n confirmations have been made
# But if different users confirm it, the Hashcash puzzle will be easier to compute.
# Hashcash puzzles such as this are easy to verify, so hackers will not transfer false money or double - spend coins
# The number ,n , varies with directly with the speed of confirmation (bytes/sec) and inversely with the amount issued out (titan).
# The constant factor, k is 40 titan-second/byte (Ts/B^-1)
